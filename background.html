            Before the European settlers arrived in the New World, the land was owned and tilled 
            by the local Native American tribes.The Wappinger tribe lived along the east bank of 
            the Hudson River from Manhattan Island to what is now Poughkeepsie and eastward to the 
            lower Connecticut River valley.

            Spared from battle during the American Revolution, Poughkeepsie became the second capital 
            of New York. In 1788, the Ratification Convention for New York State, which included 
            Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and George Clinton, assembled at the courthouse on Market Street, 
            debated, and ratified the United States Constitution. With its ratification, New York entered 
            the new union as the eleventh of the original thirteen colonies to join together as the 
            United States of America. In 1799, the residents created a new seal for the City.
